# coriolis
coriolis is an irc bot for rotating things

## planned features
note: milestones after 0.2 are not well defined yet so this list is subject to change without notice.

* [0.4] rad module system - you can write in anything that talks c
* [0.3] twitter integration - because that's what you wanted.
* [0.2] flexible command syntax - the bot can be configured to respond to a variety of forms of address such as `!command args` or `<botname>, command args`
* [0.2] less rad module system - right now if it doesn't talk nim it's probably not gonna work
* [0.2] adequate logging - a good amount of tracing (though still manual) goes right to stdout so you can see what kind of shenanigans your users are getting up to.
* [0.2] default modules - things like user authentication, joining and parting channels, spamming channels with text, etc. all the good stuff.
